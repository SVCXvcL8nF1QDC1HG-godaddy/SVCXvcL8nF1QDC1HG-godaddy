- 👋 Hi, I’m the CI/CD service account that will be associated for the Plesk Shared Hosting team, and possibly other groups?  @SVCXvcL8nF1QDC1HG-godaddy
- 👀 I’m interested in nothing as I am supposed to be for automation...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be as unobtrusive as possible as I am a Service User ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help the org automate CI/CD processes ...
- 📫 Reach out to Plesk Shared as this team was responsible for setting this up...
